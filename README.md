**Real-time sync with P2P (PeerJS), auto-load, progress-based playback alignment, and a modern UI for creating and joining watch parties.**
**Made it so my brother and cousin can use it- Reason**
**It is a work in progress and I am new to this site (github) so thanks for trying out.**

## âœ… Features
- **P2P Sync**: No central server â€“ all data flows directly via WebRTC using PeerJS.
- **Auto-Load**: Guests automatically load the same video as the host.
- **Progress-Based Sync**:
  - Eliminates offset from adaptive streams.
  - Smooth catch-up with playback speed adjustment.
  - Hard seek only when drift > 5%.
- **UI Controls**:
  - Create Party / Join Party
  - Force Sync
  - Copy Party ID
  - Sync Toggle (Coming soon)
  - Strict Host Control (Coming soon)
- **Privacy First**: No data stored on any server.

## ðŸ”’ Why P2P?
- No playback data stored on central servers.
- Faster sync with direct peer connections.
- Works fully P2P after initial signaling (serverless mode).

ðŸ›  How It Works
Built on PeerJS (WebRTC) for P2P connectivity.

Host acts as the source of truth for playback state.

Guests auto-navigate, sync progress, and adjust playback speed for smooth alignment.

No central server needed beyond initial signaling.
